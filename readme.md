Calmindon or Citadel

The Vision:
It's a web based service where maths & physics (or any kind of) excercises are collected and organized in a tagged well searchable way.

1.
Teachers can search for specific excersises and make tests or collections about them.
Students can serach for hints and solutions for them.

2.
Later it could be a dojo-like place, where students can practice.

3.
Further more
Excesises can be given with randomly generated datas.

4.
Not only datas but the main background text could be changed according to readers preferences.
For example for a girl "Cheerleaders are marching in different formations. If they are standing 3 in a row..." But for a boy it could be "The Knights of the round table are marching in different formations. If they are standing 3 in a row..."

Calmindon or Citadel

The Vision: It's a web-based service where maths & physics (or any kind of) exercises are collected and organised in a tagged well searchable way.

Teachers can search for specific exercises and make tests or collections about them. Students can search for hints and solutions for them.

Later it could be a dojo-like place, where students can practice.

Furthermore, exercises can be given with randomly generated data.

Not only data but the main background text could be changed according to readers preferences. For example for a girl "Cheerleaders are marching in different formations. If they are standing 3 in a row..." But for a boy it could be "The Knights of the round table are marching in different formations. If they are standing 3 in a row..."

TASKS:

First to build a tagging system.
Type of tags:
	o Category (categories)
	o Age (recommended age group(s) )
	o Diffculty (linked to age recomded agegroups or without it)
	o Source (source of excersise)
	o and many more
